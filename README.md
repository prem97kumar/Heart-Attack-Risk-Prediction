# Heart-Attack-Risk-Prediction 
# In this project we will Make an app which will help us predict the risk of a Heart Attack a person have.
# We will do use various Algorithms to predict the result and see which one suits best 


# We will do the following things:
 1. Data Analysis
 2. Feature Engineering
 3. Satandardization
 4. Model Building
 5. Predictions 

# We will use the following models for our predictions :
  1.Logistic Regression
  2.Decision Tree
  3.Random Forest
  4.K Nearest Neighbour
  5.SVM
